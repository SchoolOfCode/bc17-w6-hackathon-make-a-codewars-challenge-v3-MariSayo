Put your plan, story, and any supporting material here, you could use the help of a readme markdown generator such as [readme.so](https://readme.so/)

# plan

**stage 1**

- clone your repo to a folder
- make sure to do `npm install`
- install any devdependincies like `npm install vitest`
- make sure you have both `"type": "module"` and in your scripts a test for vitest `"test": "vitest"`
- This is the basic set up complete
- /////"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",   removed this from tests as it was interfering with script.

**stage 2**

# CodeWars information
- follow what the standard is/client wants. In this case our basic requirement is to build our own Kata
- TDD testing 

/// WHAT THE CLIENT WILL LOOK AT////
    - Enjoyment
    - Creativity
    - Tests and technical solution
    - The accompanying plan 


- Unit testing
- figure out the function you want solved and how to test for the edge cases.
- what are the valid or invalid inputs and outputs?
- How many test cases need to be considered?

**What are the fun ideas?**

- 1) Write a function where the numbers 1 to 7 correspond to their colour in the rainbow where the response returned is the colours as a string in order.
 - let 1 = red, let 2 = orange 
 - this idea seems too simple but lets try it and see.

 - okmore complicated than i thought

 do I want each number to correlate a colour?
 rainbow is supposed to be an array of all those colours?
 the result should be an array of the colours...

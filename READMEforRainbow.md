# Project Title

The colours of the Rainbow shine so bright!

Hello there, in this project your aims are as follows:
- Make a function where you have an array of the 7 colours of the rainbow
- ordered as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet
- return this as a string without indigo because indigo is not a colour of the rainbow and we all know that.
-return as a string!
- please also return the **originalLength** and return the **finalLength** of your array!

Here is the array so you don't need to type it all out.
    { color: "red" },
    { color: "orange" },
    { color: "yellow" },
    { color: "green" },
    { color: "blue" },
    { color: "indigo" },
    { color: "violet" }
